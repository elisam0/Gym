"""Flat (host-graded) eval-script mode for SWE dataset families.

Flat mode runs an instance's eval script directly in the sandbox and parses the
produced log host-side, computing ``resolved`` from ``FAIL_TO_PASS`` /
``PASS_TO_PASS`` via :func:`compute_resolved`. Because there is no nested
container, this runs on any exec-capable provider (docker / opensandbox).

The eval script resets the repo, applies the gold/model patch plus the test
patch, runs the repo's test command, and wraps the test output between two
sentinel markers::

    >>>>> Start Test Output
    ... per-test "PASSED <id>" / "FAILED <id>" lines ...
    >>>>> End Test Output

It also emits patch-apply / reset / timeout status codes
(``>>>>> Applied Patch`` etc.). The host-side parser in this module recognises
these markers and per-test status tokens without importing ``swebench``, so
grading can run in environments where that package (and its Docker
dependencies) is absent.

``flat_eval_enabled`` reports whether flat mode applies to a task: when the harness
selects it or the task opts in via ``SweTask.metadata["flat_eval"]``. The verifier
honors that per-task key by calling ``SweTaskHarness.with_flat_eval()`` — a no-op for
the built-in families, which already grade host-side. (A previously apptainer-only
nested grading path for swe-bench / r2e-gym was removed in PR #1694.)
