"""swe-bench / swe-bench-multilingual harness — host-side (flat) grading.

A single parametrized class serves both families. It runs the instance's official SWE-bench
eval script (``swebench.make_test_spec(...).eval_script``) inside the sandbox and grades the
produced log host-side with swebench's per-repo log parser, so it runs on any exec-capable
provider (docker / opensandbox).

NOTE: the apptainer-only nested ``run_local_evaluation`` path was removed when PR #1694 took
ownership of the apptainer provider. The swe_env-specific nested-apptainer grading (mounts/.sif
wiring + run_local_evaluation) is tracked for a follow-up PR (see APPTAINER_PR3_TRACKER.md).
