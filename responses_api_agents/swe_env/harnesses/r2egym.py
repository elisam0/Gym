"""r2e-gym harness — host-side (flat) graded.

Runs the instance's eval script in the sandbox and parses the log host-side via the shared
flat-eval path, so it runs on any exec-capable provider.

NOTE: the apptainer-only nested ``run_local_evaluation`` path (which produced r2e-gym's own
``report.json`` in-container) was removed when PR #1694 took ownership of the apptainer
provider. Re-wiring r2e-gym's nested grading + ``.sif``/mounts onto #1694's provider is tracked
for a follow-up PR (see APPTAINER_PR3_TRACKER.md); until then r2e-gym grades flat (it needs an
``eval_script`` in task metadata, else the flat grader records an **unmasked** ``resolved=False``
— reward 0, kept in the gradient — not an eval-error mask; see
``test_r2egym.py::test_run_eval_missing_eval_script_is_unmasked_unresolved``).
