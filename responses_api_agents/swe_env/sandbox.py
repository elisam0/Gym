"""Async SWE sandbox: an environment wrapper plus its acquire/teardown lifecycle.

``AsyncSweEnvironment`` is a thin async wrapper around a started sandbox that any
agent or the verifier uses to run commands and move files in and out.
``acquire_sandbox`` starts a fresh sandbox and always tears it down on exit
(normal return, exception, or cancellation).
