"""Pytest collection guard for the swe_env tests.

The flat-eval parser fixtures are recorded eval logs whose lines begin with the
SWE-bench ``>>>>>`` sentinels. Under doctest collection those look like
(malformed) ``>>>`` prompts, so the fixtures directory is excluded from
collection entirely. It holds only data, never tests.
