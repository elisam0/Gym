"""Verification orchestrator for the SWE environment.

Grades an agent's patch inline as a library call (used by anyswe and the
``swe_env`` self-driving harness) — there is no separate verifier server. Runs a
fresh-only sequence via ``acquire_sandbox`` (always-teardown), bounded by a
per-call eval timeout. A genuine wall-clock eval timeout is masked as a typed
``error_kind`` (reward 0.0); other non-timeout eval-stage failures are reported
unmasked as ``resolved=False`` (reward 0.0, kept in the gradient) to mirror
main's app.py, rather than raising.

Every eval spec is stamped with a ``ttl_s`` so TTL-honoring backends (such as
opensandbox) self-expire orphaned sandboxes.
